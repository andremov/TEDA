# Welcome to TEDA ðŸ“š

TEDA is a Python package for teaching and experimenting with **ensemble-based data assimilation** (DA) methods.

It includes toy models (e.g., Lorenz 96), prebuilt DA methods, and tools to compare their performance visually and numerically.

# API Reference â€“ Analysis Methods

TEDA includes a growing set of ensemble-based data assimilation methods, all of which inherit from the base `Analysis` interface. These methods can be instantiated directly or dynamically via the `AnalysisFactory`.

Below is a summary of available methods and the base abstract class:

## Interface: `Analysis`

All methods must implement the following interface:

```python
class Analysis(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def perform_assimilation(self, background, observation):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_analysis_state(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_ensemble(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_error_covariance(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def inflate_ensemble(self, inflation_factor):
        pass
```

## âœ¨ Creating Your Own Analysis Method

TEDA is designed to be easily extensible. You can add your own data assimilation method by implementing a custom class that inherits from the abstract `Analysis` class.

### 1. Define a New Analysis Class

Create a new Python file (e.g., `my_analysis.py`) and define a class that inherits from `pyteda.analysis.analysis_base.Analysis`:

```python
# my_analysis.py
import numpy as np
from pyteda.analysis.analysis_base import Analysis

class MyCustomAnalysis(Analysis):
    def __init__(self, param=1):
        self.param = param
        self.Xa = None

    def perform_assimilation(self, background, observation):
        # Custom assimilation logic
        self.Xa = background.ensemble  # For demonstration, no change

    def get_analysis_state(self):
        return self.Xa.mean(axis=1)

    def get_ensemble(self):
        return self.Xa

    def get_error_covariance(self):
        return np.cov(self.Xa)

    def inflate_ensemble(self, inflation_factor):
        mean = self.Xa.mean(axis=1, keepdims=True)
        self.Xa = mean + inflation_factor * (self.Xa - mean)
```

---

### 2. Save It Locally

Save your file in any location accessible from your script or notebook.

---

### 3. Register the Method Dynamically

Use the TEDA registry to make your method available in the `AnalysisFactory`:

```python
from pyteda.analysis.registry import register_analysis_from_file
register_analysis_from_file('my_analysis.py', 'my-analysis')
```

You can now use it as any other method:

```python
from pyteda.analysis.analysis_factory import AnalysisFactory

analysis = AnalysisFactory('my-analysis', param=42).create_analysis()
```
